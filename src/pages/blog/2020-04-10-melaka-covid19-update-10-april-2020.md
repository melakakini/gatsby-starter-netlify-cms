This week is the 2nd MCO which would end on 14th of April 2020. But this afternoon at 4pm the prime minister of Malaysia has just announced the 3rd phase of the MCO which would end on 28 April 2020. 

Thankfully there are positive steps taken to help the economy move again after standing still for almost 3 weeks.
